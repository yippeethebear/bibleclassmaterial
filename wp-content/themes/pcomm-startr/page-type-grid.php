					Medical and Prescription Drug Plan Changes
				</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<strong>Medical plan premiums will increase.</strong> Premiums for the CDHP are going up slightly in 2014, while premiums for the $300 Choice POS II Plan and the $500 Choice POS II Plan are increasing significantly. See the 2014 premiums <a href="/benefits/medical/#premiums">here</a> .
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Co-pays will increase for prescription drugs purchased through mail order.</strong> Go <a href="/benefits/prescription-drugs/">here</a> to see the co-pays for generic and brand-name drugs in 2014.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Health Savings Account (HSA) contribution limits will change.</b> The maximum amount of money you can contribute to an HSA in 2014 will increase to $3,300 for single and $6,550 for family coverage. This includes the amount CSX puts into your account ($1,200 for single and $2,400 for family coverage).
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>The opt-out credit will be discontinued.</strong> The $50 credit for declining medical coverage will no longer be offered in 2014. If you have waived medical coverage and do not choose new benefits, you will be enrolled in the “waive” option.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Co-pays for doctor’s office visits in the $300 Choice POS II Plan and the $500 Choice POS II Plan will be applied toward the out-of-pocket maximum.</strong> This change is being made to comply with a new health care reform requirement for 2014. (Prescription drug co-pays apply to the out-of-pocket maximum in the CDHP only.)
					</li>

					Benefits Eligibility Change
				</h2>
				<p>
					A recent Supreme Court decision has paved the way for more equitable access to programs that use marital status as a standard of eligibility, including employer-provided benefits. As a result of the landmark Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) decision, same-sex couples are now eligible to receive hundreds of federal benefits available to other married couples as long as they hold a marriage license from any of the states that grant same-sex marriages.
				</p>
				<h3>Another Eligibility Change</h3>
				<p>
					Under the previous DOMA guidelines, CSX elected to extend benefits coverage to unmarried domestic partners to help ensure that more employees had the opportunity to access the health coverage they needed for their household. However, as a result of the June 26 DOMA ruling and the ability of same-sex marriages to be legally recognized at the federal level, effective January 1, 2014, no matter where you reside across our network, health benefits will be available to all opposite-sex and same-sex spouses and children of legally married CSX employees. Domestic partner coverage will be discontinued on this date and will not be available as part of our 2014 offerings.

				<h2>
					Tobacco-User Surcharge Updates
				</h2>
				
				<p>
					If you and/or any of your covered family members are tobacco users, you will be charged <strong>an additional $50 per month on your medical premiums</strong> . (This surcharge, which started applying to employees in 2013, will also include covered family members in 2014. If applicable, the surcharge will total $50 per month, not $50 for each covered person who is a tobacco user.)
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>We define a tobacco user</strong> as an individual who has used any tobacco product, including but not limited to cigarettes, cigars, pipes and smokeless tobacco products (e.g., chew, snuff, dip, e-cigarettes, lozenges) in the three months prior to Open Enrollment.
